# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Serilog logging into the ASP.NET Core application to provide structured logging capabilities. The logging system will capture application events, errors, and diagnostic information, storing them in log files within a dedicated Logs folder under the project root directory.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured logging throughout the application, so that I can monitor application behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Serilog SHALL be configured as the primary logging provider
2. WHEN any log event occurs THEN the system SHALL write structured log entries to files
3. WHEN log files are created THEN they SHALL be stored in a "Logs" folder under the project root directory
4. WHEN the application runs THEN existing .NET logging calls SHALL automatically work with Serilog

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want log files to be organized and manageable, so that I can easily locate and analyze log data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log files are created THEN they SHALL be named with date-based patterns for easy identification
2. WHEN log files reach a certain size or age THEN the system SHALL automatically roll over to new files
3. WHEN old log files accumulate THEN the system SHALL retain only a configurable number of recent files
4. WHEN log entries are written THEN they SHALL include timestamp, log level, and structured data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want different log levels for different scenarios, so that I can control the verbosity of logging in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in Development THEN the system SHALL log at Information level or higher
2. WHEN the application runs in Production THEN the system SHALL log at Warning level or higher
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged at Error or Fatal level
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN Debug level logging SHALL be available through configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to log custom application events and exceptions, so that I can track business logic flow and error conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions are caught by the CustomExceptionFilter THEN they SHALL be logged with full details
2. WHEN business operations complete THEN relevant events SHALL be logged with contextual information
3. WHEN user actions occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail level
4. WHEN database operations happen THEN they SHALL be logged for audit purposes
